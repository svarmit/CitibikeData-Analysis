# City Bike New Stop Analysis

##Goal: Assess whether the number of Units per zip code is a good predictor of citibike trips originating from that zip code.Â¶

##Motivation:
CitiBike must distribute bike hubs efficiently. In order to do so it needs a good predictor of the number of rides originating from a location. It is a reasonable assumption that a lot of riders ride from home to their destination. It is also reasonable to assume that if the bikes are far from one's residence the rider would be discouraged from taking a bike.


This data analysis is performed using **python** . The python file presents the  the analysis/prediction using descriptive figures and **Linear regression** .
